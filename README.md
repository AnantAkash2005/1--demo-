## ✨ Quick Intro

I’m **Anant** — a BCA student building my path from zero to pro. I learn, build and document: small projects, tutorials, and college work. My focus is on **game design, graphics, and software** while preparing for internships and a remote high-income tech career. This repo is styled to give a dark, techno, multi-purpose vibe (neon green + cyberpunk gradient).
